%In recent years, some authors have been worried to investigate ways to predict the success of a movie and how much revenue it will generate. For this, they have been, e.g., using social networks data, reviews, and actorâ€™s popularity, as described below.

%Bansal et al.~\cite{2016LSISVD} also collects social media data from Twitter to predict the users' preferred movies genre and recommending movies according to the predict genre. Their model only presents the movies genres and movie recommendations, without any visualization technique. A different approach~\cite{2017PredictingMarketRevenue} that uses data from Twitter, collect tweets during the first opening week to predict the gross amount for the movie. Several machine learning algorithms were combined to find out the most accurate results.

%Shruti et al.~\cite{2014Influencesocialmedia} investigate if social media does significant influence in a movie performance. They collect data from YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook to verify if this data can impact the movie's profits. On their findings, they stated that some features are very useful to improve the prediction, but others such as Facebook likes are not reliable. They also conclude that the popularity of actors involved in the movie is one key factor for revenue.

%Other authors~\cite{2017MoviePredictionData} consider factors like movie name, year of release, genres (drama, action, romance, comedy, other), directors, music directors, producers and languages, and historical data, to use with data mining algorithms to find out the success rating of a movie.
